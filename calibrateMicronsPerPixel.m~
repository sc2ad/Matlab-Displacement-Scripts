%DESCRIPTION : This function creates a calibration period where the user
%can place/draw a line in the live view, that line represents some number
%of microns, as defined by the user, thus removing the need to fill in the
%constant: 'Microns per Inch'
%NOTE: Do make sure that the line is clearly visible of the first frame of
%the video (AS OF NOW)

%IMAGE TREATMENT

% CALIBRATE IT THROUGH VISION PROCESSING
% ONCE LINE HAS BEEN FOUND, ASK FOR MICRON LENGTH OF IT (OR BEFORE)
% CALCULATE # OF PIXELS OF THE LINE, AND DIVIDE THE MICRONS AND PIXELS TO
% GET MICRONSPERPIXEL
